Catalyst Design: DFT & Machine Learning Approaches
=============================================================

This repository collects my personal experience and knowledge on catalyst design, 
with a focus on computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
and machine learning applications. 

It includes insights into catalyst mechanism elucidation, optimization strategies, 
and the integration of machine learning models to predict catalyst behavior, 
as highlighted in state-of-the-art research articles. 

This resource is aimed at streamlining the design process and enhancing the 
understanding of catalyst systems for both theoretical and practical applications.
